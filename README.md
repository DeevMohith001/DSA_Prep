📘 Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my consistent practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
The goal of this repo is to strengthen problem-solving skills, understand patterns, and build strong coding fundamentals.

🚀 About This Repository

I solve DSA problems regularly and commit them here.

The focus is on logic building, not just writing code.

Problems are added as I progress in my DSA journey.

📅 Practice Approach

While solving problems, I focus on:

✅ Identifying the pattern behind the problem

✅ Understanding the logic, not memorizing solutions

✅ Writing clean and readable code

✅ Improving step-by-step problem-solving ability

🛠 Language Used

Java (primarily)
The main focus is on understanding algorithms rather than language-specific features.

🎯 Goals

Build strong DSA fundamentals

Improve logical thinking and pattern recognition

Prepare for coding interviews

Maintain consistency in learning

📈 Learning Philosophy

Consistency over intensity
Understanding over memorization
Patterns over individual problems
